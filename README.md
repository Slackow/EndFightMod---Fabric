- `/reset` will take you into the end with your set inventory
- `/reset out` will allow you to exit the end back into the overworld
- `/getinv` will give you the selected inventory
- `/setinv` will set your inventory to load every time
- `/charge` will make the dragon target you
- `/goodcharge [distance, height]` makes the dragon target you but teleports it in front of you at an (optional) given distance and height to give you a good angle for your bed explosion.
- `/god` toggles god mode for the player, useful for practicing bed explosions or the like
- `/god dragon` makes the dragon invincible
- `/god crystal` makes the crystals immortal
- `/heal` gives you full health and hunger
- `/killdragon` kills the dragon, does not spawn the portal.
- `/killcrystals` kills all crystals
- `/roll` acts as if the dragon took a hit, (rolls a 1/4 chance of it charging you)

List of options:

- Death box visibility (Shows the range in which you have to be in for the dragon to yeet/damage you, helping you learn to dodge)
- Fully Customizable Inventory on end load
- Healthbar shows dragon health as a number
- See how much damage you dealt to the dragon each time
- Toggle enderman on/no agro/off
- Also includes a "macro" system that lets you run any command (even vanilla) on keybinds
- Also includes a system to let you change between randomly generated end islands vs a specific one, or the one in the world you are playing on.
- Also includes a profile system, allowing you to change between inventories and different settings easily.
